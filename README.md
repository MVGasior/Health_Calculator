## Health calculator 
# 1. Data and technologies

This project is using USDA food data (link below):
https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html

It's built on Python 3.9, using Pandas, NumPy, and Sqlite3 libs.
Some features are developed in Jupyter Notebook.

# 2. First stage
Make a search and calculator of basic products and their nutritions.
Create a table with the 50 most popular products, easy to daily use.

# Goal
In the end, I would like to create an app that will scrap recipes from the web,
based on inserted nutritions (e.g. protein, carbs, saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fats)
...or even some other nutritions that the user would like to monitor.
